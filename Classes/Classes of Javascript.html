	    <h1>JavaScript language</h1>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>JavaScript offers the <strong>class</strong> syntax that's very similar to languages like Java.</p>

<p><strong>class Person {<br>
  constructor(name) {<br>
    this.name = name;<br>
  }<br>
  sayHello() {<br>
    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`;<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

const p = new Person("Maria");<br>
console.log(p.sayHello());</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript classes are just functions that must be instantiated with the <strong>new</strong> operator. Every time a class is instantiated, it returns an object containing the methods and properties that the class specified. Classes don't enforce any code organization — for example, you can have functions returning classes, or you can have multiple classes per file. Here's an example of how ad hoc the creation of a class can be: it's just an expression returned from an arrow function. This pattern is called a <strong>mixin</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>const withAuthentication = (cls) =><br>
  class extends cls {<br>
    authenticate() {<br>
      // …<br>
    }<br>
  };<br>

class Admin extends withAuthentication(Person) {<br>
  // …<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>Static properties are created by prepending static. Private properties are created by prepending a hash # (not private). The hash is an integral part of the property name. (Think about # as _ in Python.) Unlike most other languages, there's absolutely no way to read a private property outside the class body — not even in derived classes.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is single-threaded by nature. There's no <strong>paralleling</strong>; only <strong>concurrency</strong>. Asynchronous programming is powered by an <strong>event loop</strong>, which allows a set of tasks to be queued and polled for completion.</p>

<p>There are three idiomatic ways to write asynchronous code in JavaScript:</p>

<p>*Callback-based (such as <strong>setTimeout</strong>())<br>
*<strong>Promise</strong>-based<br>
*<strong>async</strong>/<strong>await</strong>, which is a syntactic sugar for Promises</p>

</p>For example, here's how a file-read operation may look like in JavaScript:</p>
<p><strong>// Callback-based<br>
fs.readFile(filename, (err, content) => {<br>
  // This callback is invoked when the file is read, which could be after a while<br>
  if (err) {<br>
    throw err;<br>
  }<br>
  console.log(content);<br>
});<br>
// Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read<br>

// Promise-based<br>
fs.readFile(filename)<>br
  .then((content) => {<br>
    // What to do when the file is read<br>
    console.log(content);<br>
  })<br>
  .catch((err) => {<br>
    throw err;<br>
  });<br>
// Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read<br>

// Async/await<br>
async function readFile(filename) {<br>
  const content = await fs.readFile(filename);<br>
  console.log(content);<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>The core language doesn't specify any asynchronous programming features, but it's crucial when interacting with the external environment — from <strong>asking user permissions</strong>, to <strong>fetching data</strong>, to <strong>reading files</strong>. Keeping the potentially long-running operations async ensures that other processes can still run while this one waits — for example, the browser will not freeze while waiting for the user to click a button to grant permission.</p>

<p>If you have an async value, it's not possible to get its value synchronously. For example, if you have a promise, you can only access the eventual result via the <strong>then()</strong> method. Similarly, await can only be used in an async context, which is usually an async function or a module. Promises are never blocking — only the logic depending on the promise's result will be deferred; everything else continues to execute in the meantime. If you are a functional programmer, you may recognize promises as <strong>monads</strong> which can be mapped with then() (however, they are not proper monads because they auto-flatten; i.e. you can't have a Promise<Promise<T>>).</p>

<p>In fact, the single-threaded model has made Node.js a popular choice for server-side programming due to its non-blocking IO, making handling a large number of database or file-system requests very performant. However, CPU-bound (computationally intensive) tasks that are pure JavaScript will still block the main thread. To achieve real paralleling, you may need to use <strong>workers</strong>.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>JavaScript also specifies a module system supported by most runtimes. A module is usually a file, identified by it's file path or URL. You can use the <strong>import</strong> and <strong>export</strong> statements to exchange data between modules:</p>

<p><strong>import { foo } from "./foo.js";<br>

// Unexported variables are local to the module<br>
const b = 2;<br>

export const a = 1;</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Haskell, Python, Java, etc., JavaScript module resolution is entirely host-defined — it's usually based on URLs or file paths, so relative file paths "just work" and are relative to the current module's path instead of some project root path.</p>

<p>However, the JavaScript language doesn't offer standard library modules — all core functionalities are powered by global variables like <strong>Math</strong> and <strong>Intl</strong> instead. This is due to the long history of JavaScript lacking a module system, and the fact that opting into the module system involves some changes to the runtime setup.</p>

<p>Different runtimes may use different module systems. For example, <strong>Node.js</strong> uses the package manager <strong>npm</strong> and is mostly file-system based, while <strong>Deno</strong> and browsers are fully URL-based and modules can be resolved from HTTP URLs.

<h2>Language and runtime</h2>
<p>Throughout this page, we've constantly mentioned that certain features are language-level while others are runtime-level.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language. The <strong>core language specification</strong> focuses on pure computational logic. It doesn't deal with any input/output — in fact, without extra runtime-level APIs (most notably <strong>console.log()</strong>), a JavaScript program's behavior is entirely unobservable.</p>

<p>A runtime, or a host, is something that feeds data to the JavaScript engine (the interpreter), provides extra global properties, and provides hooks for the engine to interact with the outside world. Module resolution, reading data, printing messages, sending network requests, etc. are all runtime-level operations. Since its inception, JavaScript has been adopted in various environments, such as browsers (which provide APIs like <strong>DOM</strong>), Node.js (which provides APIs like <strong>file system access</strong>), etc. JavaScript has been successfully integrated in web (which was its primary purpose), mobile apps, desktop apps, server-side apps, serverless, embedded systems, and more. While you learn about JavaScript core features, it's also important to understand host-provided features in order to put the knowledge to use. For example, you can read about all <strong>web platform APIs</strong>, which are implemented by browsers, and sometimes non-browsers.</p>
